In this assignment we were asked to train and evaluate simple CNN architectures on the CIFAR10 dataset using PyTorch. 
We designed 2 variations of the LeNet5 architecture to improve performance. 
We use early stopping, learning rate scheduling, pretraining, saving and transfering weights and data augmentation.

We provide the weights of all the trained models after the last epoch of training.
